## Password Generator

Very simple diceware password generator. Uses system SystemRandom for a cryptogrtaphically strong random generation... though it's more for novelty, as for my purposes it's definitely overkill.

Pretty simple:
```
python pass_gen.py -w <#words>
```

Generates a password of #words words. Uses the EFF's large wordlist, though the code can easily be altered.
